# Valorant Stats
This project started because I wanted to know my [KAST metric](https://www.thespike.gg/forums/topic/introducing-kast-metric/9703) for my ranked games in Valorant. The purpose for this project is primarily to practice working with virtual environments and GUI within Python (and also to have a bit of fun with data and statistics).

## Technical Details
This project uses [raimannma's Python wrapper](https://github.com/raimannma/ValorantAPI) to get the data.
